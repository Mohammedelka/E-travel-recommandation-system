                    <p>
                      Dharavi houses one of the biggest slums in the world. In the 18th century, it was an island, a kind of mangrove swamp
                      occupied by the Koli fishermen community. The slum was founded in 1880s during the British Raj along with urbanization
                      of Mumbai (then Bombay). The urban area of Mumbai mostly covered the southern extension of the land. The residential
                      areas were segregated between the European and native populations. Dharavi was meant for native people and hence had no
                      planning; it provided the workforce to the growing city. In 1869, the bubonic plague spread in Mumbai (and then most of
                      India) and killed about 200,000 in Mumbai alone (and about 8 million in India). Concerned about the epidemics, British
                      Raj expelled the natives living in Mumbai towards the edge, in the north of the city – to the village of Koliwadas. And
                      thus Dharavi was born. Along with the native population, polluting industries were also pushed to Dharavi, including
                      tannery and pottery, etc.
