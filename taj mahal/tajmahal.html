                <p>
                Present in the heart of the old city of Jaipur, the city palace proves the style and elegance of the Rajput royalties.
                To blend in the majestic city, the first place to stop by is this capital palace which is a sprawling complex with
                arresting buildings and collection of marvelous artifacts. Built by the Rajput king Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, a part of
                the structure has now been converted into a museum, and it also houses two huge sterling silver vessels that can store
                4,000 liters of liquid, recorded as the largest in the Guinness Book of World Records. The Royal Family still inhabits
                the palace.<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/City+Palace,+Jaipur/@26.9261375,75.8238018,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x44801531017d7b60?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY_IKOz9DMAhVE1oMKHTx1AZsQ_BIIigEwDg">Jaipur Location</a>

                <h5><a href="">Agra Fort</a></h5>
                <p>
                  As you enter and start to cross courtyard after courtyard, you
                  realize that Agra has one of the finest Mughal forts in India.
                  This red sandstone and marble architecture exudes power and
                  grandiosity. Agra fort was primarily begun by Emperor Akber in
                  1565 as a military structure and was later transformed into a
                  palace by his grandson Emperor Shah Jahan. Some of the most
                  iconic structures in Mughal history are still a part of this
                  fort, such as Shish Mahal (Mirror Palace), Diwan-e-aam (Hall
                  of general audience) and Diwan-e-khaas (Hall of private
                  audiences). The Amar Singh gate, which was originally built to
                  confuse attackers with its dogleg design, is now the sole
                  point of entry to the fort.

                <h5><a href="">Taj Mahal</a></h5>
                <p>
                  People from all around the world may not have heard of Agra,
                  but everyone knows the beautiful ivory white-marble mausoleum,
                  Taj Mahal, as the icon of love. This wonder of the world is
                  the perfect example of the intricacy and brilliance of Persian
                  and Mughal architecture. It was constructed by Emperor Shah
                  Jahan, in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Today, the
                  Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it continues to
                  hold the same magical appeal, attracting approximately eight
                  million tourists a year. Viewing of the Taj Mahal is usually
                  from sunrise to sunset, except Fridays. Night viewing of the
                  Taj Mahal is only allowed on five nights of the month: the
                  night of the full moon and two days before and after.

                <p>
                  This tomb is the first to be built in white marble instead of
                  red sandstone, which officially marked the cessation of red
                  sandstone from Mughal architecture. Itimad-ud-Daula is
                  sometimes referred to as the “baby Taj” or a draft of the Taj
                  Mahal, as it has been constructed with the same elaborate
                  carvings and pietra dura (cut-out stone work) inlay
                  techniques. The tomb is surrounded by beautiful gardens that
                  make it the perfect site to relax and experience the beauty of
                  an old era that was rich in art, culture, and history.
